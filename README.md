# Laravel Deployer Scripts

This repository contains modular Deployer scripts for provisioning servers and deploying Laravel applications. It includes configurations for Nginx, PHP-FPM, Supervisor, Node.js + Puppeteer, Redis, and a self-hosted Garage S3 storage cluster.

## Installation into a Project

The best way to use these scripts is to add this repository as a git submodule to your Laravel project. Run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:slimani-dev/.deployer.git .deployer
```

Next, copy the `deploy.php.example` file to the root of your Laravel project:

```bash
cp .deployer/deploy.php.example deploy.php
```

Finally, open `deploy.php` in your editor and update the configuration block with your repository, domain, server IP, and secrets.

### ⚠️ Security & Git Guidelines
You **MUST** add the following to your root project's `.gitignore` file to avoid leaking credentials:
```gitignore
/.deployer
deploy.php
```
*Note: The `garage/secrets.json` file auto-generated by this module is already ignored by this module's local `.gitignore`, but it's best to secure the whole folder out of your main codebase.*

## Prerequisites

To provision a brand new server, you only need exactly two things:
1. **Root user access** to the target destination.
2. **SSH keys** properly configured for the root user.

## Deployment Workflow

The entire infrastructure setup and code rollout is handled in just two commands. Run these from your local machine.

### 1. Provision the Server

```bash
dep provision
```
This command installs all required packages (PHP, Node, Nginx, Redis, Supervisor, Garage, Chrome/Puppeteer), sets up the deployer user, applies permissions, and provides you with the SSH deploy key to add to your Git repository holding your Laravel code.

### 2. Deploy the Project

```bash
dep deploy
```
This command pulls the code, installs PHP and JS vendors, maps `.env` variables, and restarts the backend services.

#### First-Run Checklist
Because the `.env` file is generated from your `.env.example`, make sure your `.env.example` is fully filled out with the structural defaults your application expects! 

After your very first deploy finishes, you should manually generate the application key and cache:

```bash
dep artisan:key:generate
dep artisan:config:cache
```
*You only need to do this once on the initial setup because the APP_KEY is not generated by default.*
